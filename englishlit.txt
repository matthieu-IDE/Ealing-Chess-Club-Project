Bad:
 I had to dig deep and find the strength to carry on
My thoughts were a jumbled mess, a labyrinth of information and uncertainty
 I felt like a ship lost at sea, tossed about by the tumultuous waves of doubt and fear
I felt like a car in a race, revving my engine but stuck in neutral, unable to move forward.
 I was in the zone, completely immersed in the task at hand. 
It was as if the world around me was shrouded in a mist, and I couldn't see clearly
My mind was racing, and my heart was pounding, and I could feel the anger simmering just beneath the surface.
 I could feel the anger bubbling up inside of me, and I knew that I was about to lose my temper.
I took a deep breath and tried to compose myself, but it was too late. 
The stress was taking its toll, and I could feel myself becoming more and more irritable.
 I was stuck in a cycle of misery, and it seemed like there was no way out.
 I could feel the frustration building inside of me, and I could feel the tears prickling at the corners of my eyes.

Good: 
 The colors were brighter, the air was clearer, and the sounds were louder.
They were like a swarm of bees, buzzing with energy and excitement
The fear and anxiety were replaced by wonder and excitement. 
Sometimes in life, it's not about the destination, but about the journey and the memories we make along the way.
The sky was a brilliant blue, and the sun was shining, casting a warm glow on the lush greenery
I  felt a sense of accomplishment and pride that I had never felt before.
The room was adorned with white roses and candlelight, and the air was thick with the scent of jasmine. 
It was a hot summer afternoon, and the sun was beating down mercilessly. 

Other:
As I looked at the ..., I felt a sense of responsibility wash over me
The clock on the wall ticked loudly, each second feeling like an eternity.
